The initial progress report for `notebook_1_liver_analysis_1.ipynb` is comprehensive, covering data loading, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and initial visualization.

Consider adding a section to the report detailing initial insights from the UMAP visualizations. For example, do the pre-existing cell types align well with the computed Leiden clusters? Are there any unexpected clusters or misalignments that warrant further investigation? This will provide immediate scientific context and guide subsequent analysis.

Now that `notebook_1_liver_analysis_1.ipynb` has refined its Leiden clustering and `notebook_2_liver_xenium.ipynb` has identified specific T/NK cell populations and begun spatial analysis, consider integrating insights between the two. Specifically, could the refined single-cell RNA-seq clusters from `notebook_1` be used to further characterize the `NKG7+ KLRB1+ T/NK` cells identified in `notebook_2`, perhaps by looking at the expression of other genes within those single-cell clusters? This could provide a deeper molecular understanding of the spatially defined cells.

With `notebook_3_liver_snRNA.ipynb` now set up for single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis, a valuable next step would be to compare the cell type annotations derived from it with those from the single-cell RNA-seq data in `notebook_1_liver_analysis_1.ipynb`. Given the different tissue processing methods (live vs. frozen tissue), subtle differences in cell type representation or gene expression profiles might emerge, particularly for delicate cell types. This comparison could lead to a more robust and comprehensive understanding of liver cell heterogeneity.

Given that you've now set up and run `notebook_3_liver_snRNA.ipynb` to capture all outputs, a logical next step would be to perform a more in-depth comparison of the identified cell populations and marker genes between the single-nucleus data (`notebook_3`) and the single-cell data (`notebook_1`). This could involve comparing specific cell type proportions, or identifying genes that are differentially expressed between "similar" cell types found in both datasets, potentially highlighting technical differences or biological insights related to tissue dissociation methods.

Given that you've now consistently captured outputs and refined visualizations in `notebook_3_liver_snRNA.ipynb`, a focused next step would be to specifically compare the UMAP layouts and clustering results from `notebook_3` (single-nucleus) and `notebook_1` (single-cell). Are the major cell populations similarly structured in both UMAPs? Do the Leiden clusters align well between the two, even with the different tissue inputs and processing? This direct visual and quantitative comparison will help assess consistency and highlight potential differences arising from the live vs. frozen tissue preparation.
