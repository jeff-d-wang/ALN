It looks like you've successfully loaded and performed initial analysis on your mouse liver scRNA-seq data, focusing on *Pdcd1* expression.

**Suggestion:** To further explore the role of *Pdcd1* in different cell types, consider generating a heatmap of *Pdcd1* expression across key cell populations. This could provide a more comprehensive view of its distribution and highlight specific cell types with particularly high or low *Pdcd1* levels.

You've now explored *Pdcd1* expression and performed Leiden clustering on your liver scRNA-seq data.

**Suggestion:** Given the newly generated Leiden clusters, a good next step would be to perform differential gene expression analysis between these clusters. This will help you identify marker genes for each cluster and potentially annotate them with known cell types, providing biological context to your clustering results.
