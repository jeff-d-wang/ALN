It looks like there's been a lot of activity with markdown cells recently, especially in `analysis5.ipynb` to document debugging. Given that, perhaps you could consider adding some more structured logging or even a simple print statement within your code in `analysis5.ipynb` to provide more concrete progress updates on those debugging efforts. This could complement the narrative in the markdown cells.

It appears that a significant number of notebooks are now being tracked, and there's been a recent trend of adding narrative and documentation, particularly in `analysis5.ipynb` regarding debugging. Since several notebooks are now being actively maintained, you might consider establishing a more consistent structure for your notebook updates. For instance, you could implement a standardized header or footer across all notebooks to clearly indicate the purpose or current status of the analysis within each notebook. This could help in quickly understanding the context of each file as your project evolves.
