It looks like you've successfully loaded and performed initial analysis on your mouse liver scRNA-seq data, focusing on *Pdcd1* expression.

**Suggestion:** To further explore the role of *Pdcd1* in different cell types, consider generating a heatmap of *Pdcd1* expression across key cell populations. This could provide a more comprehensive view of its distribution and highlight specific cell types with particularly high or low *Pdcd1* levels.
