## Research Progress Update (2025-06-27 12:42:04)

Analyzed mouse liver scRNA-seq data from `/Users/jamesbolepan/Documents/research_LiverStress_Immune/rds_manual_extract/liver_liveTissue_RNA.h5ad`. Preprocessing included normalization, log transformation, identification of highly variable genes, PCA, neighbor graph computation, and UMAP embedding. Visualizations include a UMAP plot of "Pdcd1" expression and a violin plot of "Pdcd1" expression by cell type.
