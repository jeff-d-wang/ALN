## Research Progress Update (2025-06-27 13:07:39)

This update introduces `notebook_1_liver_analysis_1.ipynb` for single-cell RNA-seq analysis of `liver_liveTissue_RNA.h5ad` using `scanpy`. The notebook performs data loading, preprocessing (normalization, log-transformation, highly variable gene selection), dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP), Leiden clustering, and marker gene identification. Key figures include UMAP visualizations colored by pre-existing cell types (Figure 1) and by newly computed Leiden clusters (Figure 2).
